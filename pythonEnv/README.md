# Python Environment  

Dependencies are managed via [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/). A full list of current dependencies is located in this directory's [toml](https://github.com/Drixitel/Iris-Adafruit-GPS/blob/main/pythonEnv/pyproject.toml) file. 

For users with poetry, the following are useful commands: 
- `poetry install`: This will install all dependencies found in the toml file 
- `poetry update`: updates dependencies

For more information, see my [Poetry Document](https://github.com/Drixitel/Poetry)
