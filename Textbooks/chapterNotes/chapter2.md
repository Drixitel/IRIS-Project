# Chapter 2: Arduino C

Summary

# Building Blocks of all Programming Languages

- Expressions
- Statements
- Staatment blocks
- Function blocks / Methods

## Expressions

Same as a math expression (not equation)

## Statements

- End with semicolon ;
- have equal signs (=)
  - Assignment operator

## Staatment blocks

- if

## Function blocks / Methods

- single operations

# Five Program Steps

- Initialization
- Input
- Processing
- Output
- Termination

## Initialization

- The code in this step is not executed again, unless the $\mu c$ is reset or power is lost and reapplied

## Input

- sequence of program statements

## Processing

- if

## Output

- handshake

## Termination

- initialization in reverse
- many $\mu c$'s are not designed to terminate

# Setup & Loop Functions

- must always be present for arduino to function

# delay()

- this is a blocking function
- use Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) instead
- check `BlinkWithoutDelay`
