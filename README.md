# IRIS Digital Dosimeter Project

## By Michelle Pichardo, Aidan Zinn, Andrew Yegiayan, and  David Smith 

The Intense Radiation Integrating Sensor (IRIS) is a novel digital dosimeter for detecting terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) - intense, millisecond-long bursts of gamma rays originating from thunderstorms that pose potential radiation hazards to aircraft and the public. IRIS will capture real-time dose rate measurements on 10 ms timescales using custom instrumentation featuring a microcontroller for digitization and timing, photodiodes for wide dynamic range, and scintillator and GPS modules.

# Contents 
1. analysis \
This directory contains Python programs specifically designed for the analysis of data files generated by the IRIS unit. The primary focus of these programs is to address concerns related to time gaps that occur during data storage. These gaps, if not managed properly, may result in missing significant events entirely.

2.  docs \
The Docs directory comprises drawings, files, and images essential for the analysis of IRIS data. These resources contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the project.

3. packages \
The Packages directory houses all active Adafruit programs relevant to the IRIS Digital Dosimeter project. 

4. sandbox \
The Sandbox directory serves as a repository for reference Adafruit programs. These programs are maintained for experimental or reference purposes, providing a space for exploration and testing.
