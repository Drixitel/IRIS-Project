# IRIS Digital Dosimeter Project

## By Michelle Pichardo, Aidan Zinn, Andrew Yegiayan, and  David Smith 

The Intense Radiation Integrating Sensor (IRIS) is a novel digital dosimeter for detecting terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) - intense, millisecond-long bursts of gamma rays originating from thunderstorms that pose potential radiation hazards to aircraft and the public. IRIS will capture real-time dose rate measurements on 10 ms timescales using custom instrumentation featuring a microcontroller for digitization and timing, photodiodes for wide dynamic range, and scintillator and GPS modules.
